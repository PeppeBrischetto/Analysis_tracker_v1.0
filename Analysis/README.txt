Macros
-------------------
A_checkTime.C          		Check that the event are ordered by total time. OBSOLETE

A_eventFinder_plot.C		find event and plot an anode map of charge and time.
				print on screen also the entry of the first pad of the event
			
A_eventFinderTrSiC_plot.C 	Find an event in coincidence between one Sic ans the tracker
				and plot the event on the anode.		

A_plot_EnergyVsChannel.C 	plot the charge vs digitizer channel in a TH2 for each digitizer

A_plot_EnergyVsPad.C		plot the charge vs pad in a TH2 for each row

A_plotMap_entries		plot the map of hit on the anode for a given number of entries

A_plotMap_time			plot the map of hit on the anode for a given interval of time

A_plot_padSpectrum.C   	 	plot the charge spectrum of a single pad in a run splitting the
				run in more pieces.

A_plot_padSpectrum_1.C  	plot the charge spectrum of multiple pad in a single plot

A_plot_padSpectrum_2.C  	plot the charge spectrum of a single pad with a condition
				on the hit multiplicity in a time window

B_anglesFinder_plot_tracker_and_sic.C  
				Macro that generate the tracks and associate the SiC hit with a 
				track. For check only. The generation of the track file is done 
				by trackGenerator.C

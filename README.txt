DIRECTORIES
################
Raw_data 	raw binary files from DAQ. One file for each digitizer.
                Raw data could be directly red from the output directory of the DAQ

Calib_files	Calibration files. They are used by converter.C to get the charge calibration and 
		the physical physical channel from the electronics channel. 
-----------
	*	channel2pad.txt		pad mapping. from electronics channel to pad number.
		pad# corresponds to channels 0,1,2,...n
		!!Do not change data formatting and the number of comment lines!!
		
	*	chargeCalib_PA.txt	charge calibration parameters (assuming a y=a*x) taking 
		into account only the preamplifiers calibration for the moment
		!!Do not change data formatting and the number of comment lines!!

Cal_data	calibrated root files, still one file for each digitizer.
		Not really necessary after Merged data are produced, can be erased.

Merged_data	One file for each run, all the data form different digitizers are merged in a 
		single file where the entries are ordered by time (raw+fine)

#Clustered_data	File where all the data from Merged data are reorganized in cluster
		Each entry is now a cluster no more an hit.  OBSOLETE

Analysis	Analysis Macros that can be considered working properly and are 

Analysis_BR     Analysis directory for IRRAD4 experiment

Analysis_Temp	Analysis directory where are te

Info		General information files

Tracks          File where all the data from Merged data are reorganized in tracks

FILES
####################
		
compila.sh	Shell script that compile converter.cc

converter_nudaq.C	converts the raw data produced by nudaq DAQ from binary to root, calibrates 
		the charge and pads #
		Input from   Raw_data
			     channel2pad.txt	
			     chargeCalib_PA.txt
		Output to    Cal_data
                
                use:  converter_nudaq.C("Raw_data/Run_18/dig22642.bin",22642,"Cal_data/out.root") 

converter_solaris_tracker.C	converts the raw data produced by solaris DAQ for the tracker from 
		binary to root, calibrates 
		the charge and pads #
		Input from   Raw_data
			     channel2pad.txt	
			     chargeCalib_PA.txt
		Output to    Cal_data
                
                use:  converter_solaris.C("Raw_data/~/solaris/RAW_data/tracker_and_sic/tracker_and_sic_116_01_22642_000.sol",22642,"Cal_data/out.root") 

converter_solaris_tracker.cc	same as converter_solaris_tracker.C but do not use root, uses its libraries.
			
		UNDER DEVELOPMENT
		use: for the moment the input data name, the digitizer ID, the output
		file name must be introduced explicitely inside the code.

converter_solaris_Sic.C	

dataProcessing.sh  Shell script that use converter_xxx_.C and merger.C generating in the final merged 
		file in a single step. Require in input just run number
		check the correct path where the file are.
		$ dataProcessing n 
		where n is the number of the run


merger.C	merge 2 root files 
		Input from Cal_data 
 		Output to Cal_data 
		
merger_v2.C	merge 5 root files togheter, written by G. Brischetto, is slower than 'merger.C'. do not use!
		Input from Cal_data 
 		Output to Cal_data 
	
readTrackerConfig.C
		Read parameters the ID of preamplifier and digitizer from th tracker configuration files.
		to be completed.

toDoList.txt	
		To do list.

trackerConfig.txt
		template for the readTrackerConfig.C macro.
		
				
trackerGenerator.C		Take as input file from tracker and (optionally) from SiC and produce a file with tracks. Each entry of the
		generated file is a tracks with a number of info for the track.  It must be introduced in the dataProcessing.sh macro
		
		Input from   Merged_data

		Output to    Tracks
